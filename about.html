                <h1>About Us</h1>
                <p>It all starts with my beloved father’s idea. And It is to setup a small Xerox shop with Photo Copy Machine and a Laminator. We start proving digital xerox and lamination of documents to our customers. Meanwhile we face the urge of customer’s need which is more than xerox. So we setup printers and laptops then begin printing documents and photos as well. With scanner inbuilt in printer we now scan and make digital copy of physical documents in almost all the formats including jpeg, png and pdf. Not just that we also setup PVC printer and now we are good to go making smart card of any legal documents.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The journey has to go long. We face issue and complains that most of the photo studio takes huge amount of time and money to photographs and this problem is solved by introducing Photo Studio in our net café. Now we can capture photos using DSLR technologies and print to the most glossy and luxury photo paper. This gives positive response  from our customers eventually giving a need for another digital service.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The next thing we realize that people and citizen have to unwillingly roam the city for small digital services like PAN, Aadhar, Voter Correction, Passport and Ayushman Bharat. Considering this issue we convert our citizen’s digital pain into a digital portal that is now called CSC (Common Services Center). But getting CSC is not an easy task. In fact our experts have to pass through series of tests by government authority and then we are given license of CSC. With CSC we become the first VLE (Village Level entrepreneur) in our locality. Now we are open to many government services that we can provide to our citizens.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rail ticket is something that passengers wait for hours in railway station for booking ticket. So We realize that we need to get them booked their rail ticket in no time. But with individual account on IRCTC we can not issue more than 5 tickets in a month and using someone’s else IRCTC account (even your own) is illegal for making business. But our experts figure it out in no time. And soon we become the authorized Agent with IRCTC. With IRCTC partner, we are free to book as many tickets as we want excluding tatkal.
                </p>

                    One day a bidder contacts us. He is extremely afraid of losing his tender in coal India because of tender closing time. This brings us another branch of HDS which is now called E-Tendering Section in Hindustan Digital Seva. With this seva started, we can help contractors how to fill online e-tender in almost all government e procurement system including coal India, IREPS, HERL and Nagar Nigam (Jharkhand Tenders). The biggest problems our engineers face is the unsupportable issue of java plugin in chrome browser. But our engineers make such software environment that we can now help fill any e-tender our customer wants. We are now helping contractors filling online e-tender but many bidders still face the issue of getting digital signature, MSME, stamp paper and contractor license. Hindustan Digital Seva contacted e-mudra and become the partner of e-mudra. With e-mudra we are now ready to make digital signature of any class with all types of certificates (signing as well as signing & encryption) issued by CA. A great thank to e-mudra for proving us digital signature certificates as well as tokens in affordable price. This makes the e-tender section so smart that the problems of getting e-stamp paper and contractor license is no longer an issue.

                    Money wire is something that now an individual has to wait in queue for hours in bank for the transaction. Keeping that thing in mind, we decide to make online transaction for our customers. But using simple saving account will not allow us to do productive job. Here comes mobisafar. We apply the partnership to mobisafar and now we can do all kind of AEPS transaction including sending money, receiving money, balance enquire in any branch without actually visiting the bank. Special thank to SBI for proving us bhim aadhar. With BHIM Aadhar money wire is now made simple and easy.
